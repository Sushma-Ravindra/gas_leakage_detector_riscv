# Gas Leakage Detector

## Table of contents

__Problem Statement__

LPG is an essential need of every household, its leakage could lead to a disaster. To alert on LPG leakage and prevent any mishaps there is a need to detect the leakage and warn people of the same.  Bursting cylinders and accidental fires have caused lots of harm to the economies in the past. This circuit triggers the alert system when smoke or gas leakage is detected. Here we have developed gas detector alarm. If gas leakage occurs, this system detects it and alerts people by buzing the buzzer attached with the circuit. These kinds of alert systems are used in modern buildings, schools, hotels, hospitals etc for sensing the flammable gases and thus preventing a major accident.

__Aim__

Now that the problem is established, the solution would be to design a detector system. This circuit triggers the alert system when smoke or gas leakage is detected. The circuit mainly uses the MQ135 Gas sensor to detect and smoke and gas leak. This MQ135 gas sensor is sensible to LPG, Alcohol, and Methane etc. This is then interfaced with our RISCV processor to make it all the more efficient. 
The functionality is to detect when a  gas leakage occurs, which is done by our sensor and then correspondingly based on the safe value, the processor triggers an alarm (in this case a buzzer) to immediately alert the users of a gas leak. 

__Materials Required__

The MQ135 Gas sensor detects the presence of a dangerous LPG leak in your car or in a service station, storage tank environment. The sensor has excellent sensitivity combined with the quick response time. The MQ-3 gas sensor has a lower conductivity to clean the air as a gas sensing material. In the atmosphere we can find polluting gases, but the conductivity of gas sensor increases as the concentration of polluting gas increases. MQ-135 gas sensor can be implemented to detect the smoke, benzene, steam and other harmful gases. It has the potential to detect different harmful gases. It is with low cost and particularly suitable for Air quality monitoring applications.The sensor can also sense iso-butane, propane, LNG, and cigarette smoke etc. Based on the enviroment where this application is needed any of the following sensors in the table below can be utilized.

The digital output pin of the sensor can be used to detect harmful gases in the environment. The sensitivity of the digital pin can be controlled by using the 10k potentiometer. If the gas is detected the indicator LED D0 will turn on and the digital pin will go from logic high to logic low (0V). The LM393 Op-Amp Comparator IC is used to compare the actual gas value with the value set using the potentiometer. If the actual gas value increases than the set value then the digital output pin gets low.

Because of the onboard LM393 comparator IC the MQ135 Gas sensor module can also be used without the need of an external microcontroller. Simply power up the module and set the sensitivity of the digital pin using the potentiometer, then when the module detects the gas the digital pin will go low. This digital pin can directly be used to drive a buzzer or LED with the help of simple transistors.

__Circuit diagrams__

The digital pin D0 of the sensor will be used to read data by the processor.
If the gas is detected the indicator LED D0 will turn on and the digital pin will go from logic high to logic low (0V). The LM393 Op-Amp Comparator IC is used to compare the actual gas value with the value set using the potentiometer. If the actual gas value increases than the set value then the digital output pin gets low. This digital pin can directly be used to drive a buzzer or LED.

This is the arduino implementation of the same :

But for this project, the implementation woule be using a riscv core.




__ C program __

```
    #include <stdio.h>
  
  // Function monitoring gas levels using sensor module
  
  void monitorgaslevel() {
      int gas_level = 0;
  
      // Replace these variables with sensor pins and setup environment
      int gas_sensor = 0; // Replace with the GPIO pin connected to sensor's digital out pin
      int buzzer = 1; // Replace with the GPIO pin connected to the buzzer
  
      
  
      while (1) {
  
          if (gas_level == 1) {
              // Simulate activating the buzzer (replace with actual buzzer control)
              // digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);
              //printf("Buzzer is ON\n");
  
          } else {
              // Simulate deactivating the buzzer (replace with actual buzzer control)
              // digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);
              //printf("Buzzer is OFF\n");
          }
      }
  }
  
  void detect_gas_level() {
      monitorgaslevel();
  }
  
  int main() {
      while (1) {
          detect_gas_level();
      }
      return 0;
  }

__Code conversion to assembly__

The assembly level code for this function can be obtained by the following commands:

Excecute this command to compile using RISC-V GNU Toolchain
```
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -c -mabi=ilp32 -march=rv32im -ffreestanding -o ./sample sample.c

```
  Excecute this command to generate assembly instructions file for the function created in the sample.c 

```
  riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -d sample.c --disassemble=newlogic  > sample_assembly.txt
```


Thus this is the obtained assembly code for our program.



__Instruction Counter__

The Assembly Instruction Counter is a Python script designed to analyze RISC-V assembly code files generated by the RISC-V GNU toolchain. It counts the number of different instructions used in the code and lists those instructions. This tool can be helpful in understanding the diversity of instructions within your assembly code.

Download: Place the sample_assembly.txt assembly code file in the same directory as the Python script (instruction_counter.py).

Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and the assembly code file. Run the following command:
```
  python instruction_counter.py
```

Number of different instructions used. The script will process the assembly code file and display the number of different instructions used along with a list of those instructions.
